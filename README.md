# DevGenAI-Nov2025

## Class links
- [Access to labs and course materials](https://us-east-1.student.classrooms.aws.training/class/fmotkSuCJZWU8eU4fgZAMK): when you open this link, you will be prompted to signin. The preferred way is using "builder id". Problem is this tipically only works with personal emails. If you want to use your corporate account, choose One-time email password (preferred) or SSO. The SSO option eventually prevents us from working properly on the labs. Once registered, you will get an access denied error until I add you to the class. Please send me the email used to register through chat. Below is a screenshot with the options:

## Class evaluation
- Go to [aws.training](https://www.aws.training/)
- Click sign in, log in with the same account you used to access the lab and course materials
- Then go on the top right to My Account, then transcript, click on the Archived section (direct link [https://www.aws.training/Account/Transcript/Archived](https://www.aws.training/Account/Transcript/Archived)
- You should see the class, with a button to evaluate
